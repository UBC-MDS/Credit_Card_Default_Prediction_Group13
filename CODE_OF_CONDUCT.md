This project is created and maintained by students of the MDS Master of Data Science Program, class of 2023. 
As such, this project will adhere to both the UBC Student Code of Conduct and the UBC MDS Leadership Code of Conduct. 
Additionally, our project will follow the Code of Conduct below in the interest of fostering a respectful, collaborative, 
and supportive environment where each member is appreciated for their efforts and contributions, regardless of their 
country of origin, ethnic background, gender, nationality, age, sexual orientation, physical abilities, socio-economic 
status, educational and professional background, or religion.
